## Installation

In your react native project, run `npm install react-native-search-bar --save`

To link this library, please follow the first two steps in the [Linking Libraries (iOS)](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html) guide on React Native website. The `.xcodeproj` file is in `node_modules/react-native-search-bar/`. In the end, you should have `RNSearchBar.xcodeproj` in the `Libaries` group on Xcode and `libRNSearchBar.a` in the `Link Binary With Libraries` section inside the `Build Phases` tab of your project target.

## Update

In your react native project, run

```Bash
npm install react-native@latest --save # optional, just for the latest react-native
npm install react-native-search-bar@latest --save
```

## Usage

```JSX
<SearchBar
	ref="searchBar"
	placeholder='Search'
	onChangeText={...}
	onSearchButtonPress={...}
	onCancelButtonPress={...}
	/>
```
```javascript
this.ref.searchBar.focus()
```

For all supportted properties, please check out `propTypes` in either [SearchBar.coffee](SearchBar.coffee) or [SearchBar.js](SearchBar.js).

There is also an example project in the [SearchBarExample](SearchBarExample) directory.
